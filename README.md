# About the project

The start of creating an application/website through API inputs and using react led us to creating an interactive page with self updating info presented. This collected a certain local area's weather and temperature and gave recommendations on garments or clothing for the day. There was also a module created to input new clothing options depending on the time of day, and weather classification. This project was aided through TripleTen's project guidance, OpenWeatherAPI, and Figma.
